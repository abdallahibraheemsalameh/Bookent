# My Graduation Project 
me and my colleague developed an application to encourage people to revive the reading habit using physical books. Our application simplifies the process of reading physical books.
a person can search for books he wants to read, then he can ask for exchange it with another book or rent it for free.
once he finishes reading a book, he can return the book back to make it available for another person.
The application is really very helpful for the reader as they can rent or exchange a book instead of buying and wasting money.
